# Dual-Axis-solar-tracker
A dual-axis solar tracker is an automated system that adjusts a solar panel's orientation along two axes—horizontal (azimuth) and vertical (elevation)—to follow the sun's position. Using an Arduino, this system can increase energy output by up to 40% compared to fixed solar installation.
